/*
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
a**2 + b**2 = c**2

For example, 3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.

/*
First thing I need to do is identify all pythagorean triplets until sum is equal to 1000

Once I find those I just need to multiply them
